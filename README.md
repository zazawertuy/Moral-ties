# Abstract                                                                                                                                         
We present an analytical framework for studying the influence of networks on the adherence to social norms as a
result of peer pressure. We introduce a new concept, termed moral ties, that combines the agentsâ€™ actions with
network metrics and allows quantifying the capacity of agents to exercise and coordinate peer pressure. The 
effects of moral ties on peer pressure are non-linear and independent from group size. Only isomorphic networks
with respect to moral ties present identical peer pressure. We signpost the minimal and maximal effects of moral
ties on peer pressure for networks of any topology and size and discuss policy implications for the promotion of social norms.   

# Code
1.- The folder "Networks" contains networks with 1000 and 7500 nodes ordered by an increasing value of clustering coefficient.

2.- The file "code/Moral Ties.py" in Python uses the networks presented in folder "Networks" and provides the metrics for both
Direct Moral Ties and Indirect Moral Ties. It also provides the inputs for the numerical verification of the proofs for Theorems 1 and 3 in the article.

3.- The file "code/proofs of Theorems 1 and 3.R" in R provides the numerical verification of the proofs for Theorems 1 and 3 in the article.
