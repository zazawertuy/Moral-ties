# Abstract                                                                                                                                         
We study cooperation and group pressure on social networks by introducing a new concept termed norm-enforcing ties. By combining network characteristics and agents’ actions, direct and indirect norm-enforcing ties extend and refine the concept of social ties as well as the role of the tightness of the knit of a group as drivers of group pressure and cooperation. The results show that a strong commitment by agents with collective interests, or a high degree of confrontation between agents minimizes the effect of indirect norm-enforcing ties on cooperation. The analysis in terms of the agent’s utility reveals that an increase in indirect norm-enforcing ties does not necessarily lead to a decrease in the critical mass of compliers supporting cooperation. We demonstrate that network-oriented policies are more efficient in promoting cooperation than are standard economic policy instruments when the expected intensity of direct norm-enforcing ties is sufficiently large compared to the tightness of the knit of the group. Otherwise, the standard economic policy instruments are more efficient.

# Code
1.- The folder "Networks" contains networks with 1000 and 7500 nodes ordered by an increasing value of group cohesiveness.

2.- The file "code/Norm Enforcing ties.py" in Python uses the networks presented in folder "Networks" and provides the metric for both
Direct Moral Ties and Indirect Moral Ties. It also provides the inputs for the numerical verification of the proofs for Theorems 1 and 3 in the article.

3.- The file "code/proofs of Theorems 1 and 3.R" in R provides the numerical verification of the proofs for Theorems 1 and 3 in the article.

4.- The file "code/JEIC Figures.nb" in Mathematica reproduces the Figures 2-4 of the article and Figures C1-C4 and Figure D1 of its Appendices.
