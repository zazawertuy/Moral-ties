# Abstract                                                                                                                                         
We study cooperation and group pressure in social networks by introducing a new concept termed moral ties. By combining network characteristics and agents’ actions, 
moral ties extend and refine the concept of social ties as a driver for group pressure. Direct moral ties depend on the size of the group the agent relates to and the
dissimilarity between the actions taken by the agent and the actions taken by the group. Indirect moral ties take account of the cohesiveness of cooperators and express 
the capacity of cooperative agents to coordinate group pressure. Individual decisions are driven by private net benefits and group pressure where the latter is the 
result of direct and indirect moral ties. Once group pressure exceeds the threshold of private net benefits agents switch from non-cooperation to cooperation. We find
that, depending on the relationship between group polarization and the level of the agents’ commitment with collective interest, group size and indirect moral ties are
either complements or substitutes of direct moral ties for attaining the threshold. We determine the efficient policy (formal vs. informal) for increasing indirect moral
ties  as a function of direct moral ties and group cohesiveness at the network level. We find that informal policies are more efficient when group cohesiveness is below
one half, and the strength of direct moral ties is at least twice the value of group cohesiveness. Otherwise, formal polices are more efficient.    

# Code
1.- The folder "Networks" contains networks with 1000 and 7500 nodes ordered by an increasing value of group cohesiveness.

2.- The file "code/Moral Ties.py" in Python uses the networks presented in folder "Networks" and provides the metrics for both
Direct Moral Ties and Indirect Moral Ties. It also provides the inputs for the numerical verification of the proofs for Theorems 2 and 3 in the article.

3.- The file "code/proofs of Theorems 2 and 3.R" in R provides the numerical verification of the proofs for Theorems 1 and 3 in the article.
