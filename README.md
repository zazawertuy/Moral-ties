# Abstract                                                                                                                                         
We study cooperation and group pressure on social networks by introducing a new concept termed norm-enforcing ties. By combining network characteristics and agentsâ€™ actions, direct and indirect norm-enforcing ties extend and refine the concept of social ties and the role of cohesiveness as drivers of group pressure and cooperation. The results show that a strong commitment by agents with collective interests or a high degree of confrontation minimizes the effect of indirect norm-enforcing ties on cooperation. The results show that an increase in indirect norm-enforcing ties does not necessarily lead to a decrease in the critical mass of compliers for supporting cooperation. We demonstrate that network-orientated policies are more efficient in promoting cooperation than standard economic policy instruments when the expected strength of direct norm-enforcing ties is at least twice the value of the expected group cohesiveness of the network. Otherwise, economic policy instruments are more efficient. 

Keywords: Social norms; social network; cooperation; social dilemma, network-orientated policies.

# Code
1.- The folder "Networks" contains networks with 1000 and 7500 nodes ordered by an increasing value of group cohesiveness.

2.- The file "code/Norm Enforcing ties.py" in Python uses the networks presented in folder "Networks" and provides the metric for both
Direct Moral Ties and Indirect Moral Ties. It also provides the inputs for the numerical verification of the proofs for Theorems 1 and 3 in the article.

3.- The file "code/proofs of Theorems 1 and 3.R" in R provides the numerical verification of the proofs for Theorems 1 and 3 in the article.

4.- The file "code/JEIC Figures.nb" in Mathematica reproduces the Figures 2-4 of the article and Figures C1-C4 and Figure D1 of its Appendices.
