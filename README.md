# Abstract                                                                                                                                         
We study cooperation and group pressure on social networks by introducing a new concept termed moral ties. By combining network characteristics and agentsâ€™ actions,
direct and indirect moral ties extend and refine the concept of social ties and the role of cohesiveness as drivers of group pressure and cooperation. The results
show that a strong commitment by agents with collective interests or a high degree of polarization minimizes the effect of indirect moral ties on cooperation. We
demonstrate that an increase in indirect moral ties does not necessarily lead to a decrease in the critical mass of compliers for supporting cooperation. We demonstrate
that informal policies are more efficient in promoting cooperation than formal policies are when the expected strength of direct moral ties is at least twice the value
of the expected group cohesiveness of the network. Otherwise, formal policies are more efficient. 

Keywords: Cooperation; Social networks; Group polarization; Moral motivation; Social dilemma; Social norms.

# Code
1.- The folder "Networks" contains networks with 1000 and 7500 nodes ordered by an increasing value of group cohesiveness.

2.- The file "code/Moral Ties.py" in Python uses the networks presented in folder "Networks" and provides the metric for both
Direct Moral Ties and Indirect Moral Ties. It also provides the inputs for the numerical verification of the proofs for Theorems 2 and 3 in the article.

3.- The file "code/proofs of Theorems 2 and 3.R" in R provides the numerical verification of the proofs for Theorems 1 and 3 in the article.

4.- The file "code/MT Figures.nb" in Mathematica reproduces the Figures 2-4 of the article and Figures C1-C4 and Figure D1 of its Appendices.
